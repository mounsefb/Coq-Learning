Software Foundation Summary : 

      - [intros]: move hypotheses/variables from goal to context

      - [reflexivity]: finish the proof (when the goal looks like [e =
        e])

      - [apply]: prove goal using a hypothesis, lemma, or constructor

      - [apply... in H]: apply a hypothesis, lemma, or constructor to
        a hypothesis in the context (forward reasoning)

      - [apply... with...]: explicitly specify values for variables
        that cannot be determined by pattern matching

      - [simpl]: simplify computations in the goal

      - [simpl in H]: ... or a hypothesis

      - [rewrite]: use an equality hypothesis (or lemma) to rewrite
        the goal

      - [rewrite ... in H]: ... or a hypothesis

      - [symmetry]: changes a goal of the form [t=u] into [u=t]

      - [symmetry in H]: changes a hypothesis of the form [t=u] into
        [u=t]

      - [transitivity y]: prove a goal [x=z] by proving two new subgoals,
        [x=y] and [y=z]

      - [unfold]: replace a defined constant by its right-hand side in
        the goal

      - [unfold... in H]: ... or a hypothesis

      - [destruct... as...]: case analysis on values of inductively
        defined types

      - [destruct... eqn:...]: specify the name of an equation to be
        added to the context, recording the result of the case
        analysis

      - [induction... as...]: induction on values of inductively
        defined types

      - [injection... as...]: reason by injectivity on equalities
        between values of inductively defined types

      - [discriminate]: reason by disjointness of constructors on
        equalities between values of inductively defined types

      - [assert (H: e)] (or [assert (e) as H]): introduce a "local
        lemma" [e] and call it [H]

      - [generalize dependent x]: move the variable [x] (and anything
        else that depends on it) from the context back to an explicit
        hypothesis in the goal formula

      - [f_equal]: change a goal of the form [f x = f y] into [x = y] *)
      
Usual cases :

H : forall x0 : T, x = x0 \/ In x0 l -> P x0
x0 : T
H0 : In x0 l

apply H.

OR 

specialize (H x0)

--------------------------------------------------

j'ai ça : H0: In x l
et ça demontré plus tôt : Theorem In_map :
  forall (A B : Type) (f : A -> B) (l : list A) (x : A),
         In x l ->
         In (f x) (map f l).
         
apply In_map.

--------------------------------------------------
if odd n then Podd n else Peven n

appliquer : destruct (odd n)

--------------------------------------------------
Podd, Peven: nat -> Prop
n: nat
H: Peven n
H0: false = true

Podd n

discriminate. marche dans ce cas là car egalité de constructeurs = contradiction.
